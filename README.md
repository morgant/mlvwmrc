## OVERVIEW

This a set of configuration files for Takashi HASEGAWA's [Macintosh-like Virtual Window Manager (MLVWM)](http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~y-miyata/mlvwm.html) with the following goals:

- More accurate emulation of [System 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7) and [MacOS 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_8) User Interfaces
- A complete configuration out-of-the-box
- Well structured configuration files

MLVWM includes a very rudimentary set of rc ([run command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_commands)) files and requires a fair amount of customization to better emulate Macintosh operating systems' UI. Additionally, since it is generally no more than a hobbyist window manager, no appropriate structure for the rc files (esp. for individual applications), icons (i.e. pixmaps), etc. Last, but not least, I wanted to reduce the amount of configuration needed every time I configure MLVWM on a new workstation.
